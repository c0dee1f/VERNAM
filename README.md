VERNAM is a tiny, drag-and-drop file encryptor that runs entirely in the browser.
Drop a file, set a passphrase, done. Drop the encrypted file back in, type the
passphrase, get your original. That is the whole product.

It is named after **Gilbert Vernam**, inventor of the one-time pad, the only cipher
ever mathematically proven unbreakable. VERNAM (the tool) is not a literal one-time
pad, but it is built on its descendant: XChaCha20, a modern stream cipher.

Made by [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io).

## Why it is different

- **Nothing leaves your device.** No uploads, no cloud, no servers. Go offline and it still works.
- **No account, ever.** No sign-up, no email, no tracking.
- **Any file, any size.** Large files stream straight to disk instead of eating your memory.
- **Tamper-evident.** Change one byte and decryption fails loudly.
- **Open source.** Audit it, fork it, host it yourself.

## Cryptography

- **Key derivation:** Argon2id stretches your passphrase into a 256-bit key.
- **Encryption:** XChaCha20-Poly1305 via libsodium's `secretstream` (authenticated, streaming).
- **Integrity:** per-chunk authentication plus truncation and reordering detection.

These are the same peer-reviewed primitives behind Signal, WireGuard, and 1Password.
The container format is documented in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md).

> **One honest warning:** there is no backdoor and no recovery. If you forget the
> passphrase, the file is gone. That is the point. Use the built-in generator and
> store it somewhere safe.

## Please host your own copy

We *want* this everywhere. The more places strong, free encryption lives, the harder
it is to take away. Put VERNAM on your own domain, your blog, your company intranet,
a USB stick, anywhere. There is **no build step and no dependencies to install**, it is
a handful of static files.

**Run it locally:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LifetimeLabsDev/VERNAM.git
cd VERNAM
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

(Any static file server works. Opening `index.html` as a `file://` will not, because
browsers block WebAssembly and the File System Access API on the `file:` scheme.)

**Put it on the web:** drop the folder on any static host (your own nginx, GitHub
Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages). No backend, no config. That is exactly how
[VERNAM.app](https://VERNAM.app) runs.

Streaming-to-disk for large files uses the File System Access API (Chromium-based
browsers). Firefox and Safari fall back to an in-memory download, capped at 2 GiB.

## The one condition: link back to PrivacyTools.io

VERNAM is released under the **[VERNAM License](LICENSE)** (a custom, WTFPL-style
license, not OSI-approved). Do almost anything you like with it, copy it, change it,
sell it, ship it, **on one condition: keep a clear, visible, working link back to
[PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io)** on any hosted or distributed copy.

Concretely, if you run VERNAM as a website or app, put a real, clickable link to
`https://www.privacytools.io` somewhere ordinary visitors can see it. A footer line is
plenty, for example:

> Powered by [VERNAM](https://www.privacytools.io/encrypt), from [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io).

Make the link work, and do not imply that PrivacyTools.io endorses your version. That is
the entire ask. We would rather you spread this far and wide than lock it down, the
link is how we keep the lights on. The exact terms (including the patent grant and the
names/trademark note) are in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

VERNAM also bundles a few permissive third-party components (libsodium under the ISC
License, the BIP-0039 wordlist under the MIT License); keep their notices in
[THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt](THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt) when you redistribute. The crypto
primitives themselves (XChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id, BLAKE2) are open, unpatented
standards.

## Brand assets

Writing about VERNAM, or adding that credit link? Grab the logo, the cipher-grid mark,
and the color palette from the PrivacyTools.io brand kit instead of recreating them by
hand:

## What is in here

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `index.html` | The page: hero, the tool card, and the marketing sections. |
| `assets/css/card.css` | Styles for the tool card. |
| `assets/js/vernam-ui.js` | Wiring for the tool card (drives the engine). |
| `assets/js/vernam.js` | The crypto engine. Exposes `window.Vernam`. |
| `assets/js/wordlist.js` | BIP-0039 English wordlist for the passphrase generator. |
| `assets/vendor/sodium.js` | Vendored libsodium (ISC). No CDN, works offline. |
| `FORMAT.md` | The `.vrn` file format spec. |
| `LICENSE` | The VERNAM License (see above). |
| `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` | Notices for the bundled components. |

> The tool card (`index.html`'s card markup, `assets/css/card.css`, `assets/js/vernam-ui.js`) and the engine
> (`assets/js/vernam.js`) are generated from the canonical PrivacyTools.io source, so this copy
> always matches the live tool at privacytools.io/encrypt.

### Using the engine on its own

```html
<script src="assets/vendor/sodium.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/wordlist.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/vernam.js"></script>
<script>
  await Vernam.ready();
  // encryptFile / decryptFile take a File and a passphrase
  const result = await Vernam.encryptFile(file, "correct horse battery staple", {
    profile: "standard",            // or "high"
    onStage:    s => console.log(s),
    onProgress: f => console.log(Math.round(f * 100) + "%"),
  });
  // Vernam.detect(file) -> "encrypt" | "decrypt"
  // Vernam.generatePassphrase(6), Vernam.strength(str)
</script>
```
